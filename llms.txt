# MCP-Jest

> The testing framework for Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers. Like Jest, but for MCP. Test your MCP server tools, resources, and prompts with automated testing, snapshot testing, and CI/CD integration.

MCP-Jest helps developers test their MCP servers that connect AI assistants (Claude, ChatGPT, etc.) to databases, file systems, or APIs. It provides automated, repeatable testing with Jest-like syntax.

## Quick Start

- [Getting Started Guide](/docs/guides/getting-started.md): Step-by-step setup guide
- [CLI Reference](/docs/cli-reference.md): Complete CLI documentation
- [API Reference](/docs/api/README.md): Library API documentation

## Installation

```bash
npm install mcp-jest        # As dependency
npm install -g mcp-jest     # Or globally for CLI
```

## Basic Usage

```javascript
import { mcpTest } from 'mcp-jest';

const results = await mcpTest(
  { command: 'node', args: ['./server.js'] },
  { tools: ['search', 'email'] }
);
```

Or via CLI:

```bash
mcp-jest node ./server.js --tools search,email
```

## Features

- Automated Testing: Write tests once, run them everywhere
- Comprehensive Coverage: Test connections, tools, resources, and prompts
- Snapshot Testing: Capture and compare MCP outputs over time
- CI/CD Ready: Works with GitHub Actions, Jenkins, CircleCI
- Protocol Validator: Check MCP compliance with detailed scoring
- Watch Mode: Auto-rerun tests when files change
- HTML Reports: Generate beautiful, shareable test reports
- Multiple Transports: stdio, HTTP Streaming, SSE support
